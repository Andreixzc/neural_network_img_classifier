# Overview:
Search Algorithms in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The report presents results from tests using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on two different datasets to assess the CNN's performance and analyze structural changes' impact. The report emphasizes the CNN's significance in image classification due to its learning and generalization capabilities. Two datasets, "Dog and Cat" and "The Simpsons (Bart and Homer)," are discussed, along with results.
